OPTIshell timber gridshell deliver the best structural-energy performance at a minimal cost while providing outstanding aesthetics.
OPTIshell is an asymptotic gridshell based on a minimal surface. The structure is fabricated with planar straight strips of material with no waste and assembled from a flat bi-directional grid.
