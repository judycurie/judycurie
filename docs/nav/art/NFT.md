## Game Wars Collection
“Keep up the good work, if only for a while, if only for the twinkling of a tiny galaxy.”
– Wislawa Szymborska

The Game Wars is a self-organizing generative art that emerges without a designer. It is a question about free will, consciousness and destiny. It is a cellular automata, where the evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It is a zero-player game.

Noone can play Game Wars.
Noone wins Game Wars.

Stop war.
