#Supervising and mentoring

I was for many years an official supervisor of the research group LabDigiFab at Wroclaw University of Technology and Science. Between 2016 and 2018 I was Young Talent Architecture Award (YTAA) Representative for the Faculty of Architecture at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. One of the nominated by me projects S’lowtecture: housing structure by Tomasz Broma won in the completion and was presented at 15th International Architecture Exhibition– La Biennale di Venezia.
