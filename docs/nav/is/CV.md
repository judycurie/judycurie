### **Organisation of international conferences**
I was one of the main organizers of the first international conference organized in Poland in the field of computer-aided design. SHAPES OF LOGIC International Conference of Parametric Design 2015, 13-15th March 2015,
Wrocław, Poland. Organizers: LabDigiFab (Marta Pakowska, Joanna Symonowicz, Judyta Cichocka, Maciej
Nisztuk, Jakub Ławicki, Konrad Kulwicki, Magdalena Grzegorzewska, Agnieszka Wolska).

### **Participation in industrial innovation**
My research has been always application-oriented, therefore during my carrier I collaborated with industry (AJ System, Perfopol, 3YOURMIND). I also set-up my own innovation-based company Parametric Support UG. In 2016, I received a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy (BMWi) to create an application for multi-criteria optimization of architectural design. The optimizer co-created by me was awarded in the preset competition "MACHINE LEARNING ACROSS DISCIPLINES" organized by MIT in 2019. The application was used in the optimization of several projects in Mexico and Germany in cooperation with such offices as: Fernando Romero Enterprise, Tatiana Bilbao or GVA Architectos. My company Parametric Support UG was providing consulting services in the field of Architectural Design Optimization (ADO), and in 2017 was
selected to TOP30 of European companies working to improve the climate of CLIMATE-KIC.

### **Prizes and Awards**
