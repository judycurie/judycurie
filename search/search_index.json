Key take aways: the angle between joints change more further from the center -> joints closer to legs(supports) need more rotational freedom the joints should allow movement 75-90 deg (more is not necessary e.g. most right example) 06 - Testing Interlocking Connections As for one-time assembly the kinetic joints might not be necessary and it will be enough to account for the rotation between flat and fully assembled state providing adequate tolerances in slots. However, as the slots are bigger to allow some rotation they also cause the problem of elements sliding from each other in the flat state. Material: PET, 1.18mm The laser either didnt cut through or removed the bumps. The pocket size made a difference in the possible rotations at joints. The best worked the cut on the small machine with: cut - s4.0, 75p engrave - s80 p65 with the kerf: clear - 0.8 - 1.45, 1.28 (0.4-0.65mm kerf - slower on arc) pocket - 1,65 - 1.76, 1.81 (0.1-0.15mm kerf - line cut) big machine: cut: s3.0, p90 engrave: s80 p70 clear - 0.8 - 1.47, 1.52 (0.67-0.72mm kerf - slower on arc) pocket - 1.65 - 1.87, 1.95 (0.22-0.30mm kerf - line cut) Key take aways: the scaled model needs to be larger than scale 1:18 or 1:10 to be cut with laser and these joints the bump needs to be bigger than kerf on arc cut 07 - Structurally Feasible 1:1 model For the kinetic-actuated assembly with simple joints (cuts in the laths), I have to keep the structure of the asymptotic gridshell from a single layer of asymptotic laths. However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance. Key take aways: assuming the 1:1 gridshell structure with filling developable plates the structural performance is satisfactory Next steps: calculation of the material thickness for 1:5 stiffness scaled model -> testing the kinetic joints with tolerances - > preparation of the fabrication files 08 - Stiffness-scaled model Calculating the thickness of plywood for stiffness-scaled model 1:5.

Stiffness scaled model. Left: The real structure laths 6.5mmx100mm double layer, Birch plywood, Right: model 1:5 laths 1mmx20mm, single layer Birch. Key take aways: considering stiffness-scaling, already for 1:5 scale, I need a very thin plywood of 0.8mm-1mm, therefore the 1:5 scale was considered as suitable for prototype 09 - Assembly membrane After trying to make a list of materials and where to get them -> I discovered that there is no way (really no way) to find thin plywood in Mexico. I considered ordering it from the US, or even Finland or Poland, but the amount for the model needed (like 1 board for 1:5 prototype) and even if 4 boards to allow the mistakes, the costs and taxes, and effort is not proportional to the amount I need. Therefore after reviewing if I can make it from aluminum sheets, as this is also common for real structures, the thinnest aluminum 0.5mm is already very stiff, what would mean the model would be bigger than 1:5, and no possibility to cut the aluminum in local fab or with the aluminum provider offering cutting services, I looked for alternative ways to erects resembling shape. Designing a membrane which can erect the structure and potentially stay on the structure after assembly is a great idea. I managed to calculate the inflatable surfaces of the membrane to resemble exactly the shortening and extending of the diagonals of the grid. Membrane Design resembling the shortening of the diagonals: More about the design process: week16 Key take aways: although it is a great idea and I would really like to make it, I have the same problem as with grid strucutre -> I don't know what material and where to find it and if I find it on time, and even if I find it -> I never made inflatable with laser and I have no idea how long it can take me to produce it I need a air pump -> following the Neil's advice I reviewed this: https://www.softrobotics.io/, aware about ticking clock for the final project, I gave a shot and emailed them asking if I can borrow one unit for the course time or if there is a chance they can send me the components for assembly of it, however I was left without reply no inflatable membrane for the final project 10 - IP, Planning CC - Creative Common License: Key take aways: I touched the thinnest aluminum sheets available and realize they are too stiff for any model scale I have a lot of PET20, PET30, PET40- > and now this is the only option -> I need to make a laser tests and choose a scale for the model finding the scale for the acrylic thickness I have also reviewed CC licenses and chose: Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC- 4.0). 11 - Acrylic Model I design and produce samples to assess the kerf and possible precision of cutting for PET20, PET30, PET40. Obviously the best precision was for the thinnest PET20. Fig. Self-interlocking joint test PET20 V4 with tolerance allowing flat assembly (50-90deg) - it worked well :). The PET30 &PET 40 was not possible to be cut on laser with a detail allowing controlling the tolerances (slot size for rotation) & bump slot design stopping the stripes from falling, therefore I had to find a scale for the PET20 for which elements has enough stiffness. I made first the model 1:10 from PET20 - it was to slender. I assembled also model 1:20, that was still not stiff enough. The next attempt was successful: PET20 1:25 scale -> elements had enough stiffness and could be cut with satisfactory precision so that the self locking joints hold the laths. After 2 hours of removing carefully elements from the acrylic sheet without breaking: After 5 hours of cleaning elements with aceton and assembling the flat structure: More about the fabrication process: week18 Key take aways: I hate cutting plastic it is great that asyptotic gridshell work so well as a system, but also it makes it almost impossible to evaluate performance of structure based on 2 laths connected - > only assembling the whole model the scale and/or thickness could be evaluated :( Selected laser parameters: PET-G 20 0.55mm : Overall: S11P100: Divided: ->S10P100/S11P100 - long Lines ->S13P100 - details PET-G 30 0.74mm : Overall: S10P100: Divided: ->S10P100/S09P100 - long Lines ->S11P100 - details 11 - Rotation freedom material thickness = t Slot size for (not accounting for kerf/beam size): 90 = 1t 75 = 1.22t 60 = 1.36t 45 = 1.42t To achive these exat sizes for slotes, the beamsize (or kerf if materials melts substantially) should be substructed from the result. Example: Material thickness = 1mm, we would like to allow for 60 degree rotational freedom, the beam size/kerf of the laser used 0.05mm: slot size (NOT accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 = 1.36mm slot size (accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 - 0.05 = 1.31mm 12 - Rotation freedom material thickness = t Slot size for (not accounting for kerf/beam size): 90 = 1t 75 = 1.22t 60 = 1.36t 45 = 1.42t To achieve these exact sizes for slots, the beam size (or kerf if materials melts substantially) should be subtracted from the result. Example: Material thickness = 1mm, we would like to allow for 60 degree rotational freedom, the beam size/kerf of the laser used 0.05mm: slot size (NOT accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 = 1.36mm slot size (accounting for kerf) = 1mm * 1.36 - 0.05 = 1.31mm 13 - Model 57 Plywood 0.6mm (real 0.69mm) kerf with the Speed 100 Power 100 on the small slot (1mm)- 0.3mm both sides / 0.15mm one side if t = 0.69mm - 75 = 1.22*0.69 = 0.8418 if the slot in the laser cut will have 0.6mm, in reality it will result in the slot 0.9mm and will allow for 75 rotation movement 13 - Model 39 Plywood 1.0mm (real 1.09mm) kerf with the Speed 100 Power 100 on the small slot (1mm)- 0.3mm both sides / 0.15mm one side if t = 1.09mm - 75 = 1.22*1.09 = 1.3298 if the slot in the laser cut will have 1.0mm, in reality it will result in the slot 1.3mm and will allow for 75 rotation movement","title":"Gridshell"},{"location":"nav/art/projects/gridshell/#gridshell","text":"Fig. Conceptual model.","title":"Gridshell"},{"location":"nav/art/projects/gridshell/#01-architectural-design","text":"I reviewed some research papers about asymptotic gridshells.

However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance.

Two proposal V1 and V2 can be built as a stand-alone structures. However for the modular assembly is important for the possibilities to cover large spaces. Some modular arrangements are presented below. Fig 2. Modular arrangements - top view. Fig 3. Modular arrangements - isometry. 02- Prototyping Fabrication I prepared the first model from the thin plywood to test the unrolling script. Simulation & Reality movies availeble on Youtube - simulation - model folding Design & Fabrication The beauty of asymptotic gridhshell lies in the ease of fabrication. The 3D laths unroll to flat starlight strips which can be manufactured by laser, milling or even by hand. To produce below fabrication layout, I prepared a custom Python script for unrolling and labeling of the elements and joints. The code produces layout for the bottom layer of the asymptotics. The script accounts for the laser beam size (kerf), material thickness, width of the material and tolerances. The joint connection shape can be rectangular or defined by custom draw curve. Key take aways: the material thickness was around 0.88mm, and the slot had 1mm width, not taking into account kerf, allowing on the rotation around 75deg -> this caused difficulty to assemble it in the flat state, but also triggered the self-assembly effect larger tolerances on joints cause that elements that has few connections required fastening to not fall off from the flat model state Next steps: accounting for kerf, and the mobility of 60 deg will help in the flat assembly, but decrease the self assembly \"willingness\" self-interlocking joint would allow to keep the larger tolerances and prevent from falling of elements in the flat state 03 - Structural Analysis: Single vs Double Layer Design Workflow Realizing the complexity of the asymptotic gridshell design enabling erection from a flat grid. source: Schling, E., & Schikore, J.

Key take aways: the angle between joints change more further from the center -> joints closer to legs(supports) need more rotational freedom the joints should allow movement 75-90 deg (more is not necessary e.g. most right example) 05 - Structurally Feasible 1:1 model For the kinetic-actuated assembly with simple joints (cuts in the laths), I have to keep the structure of the asymptotic gridshell from a single layer of asymptotic laths. However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance. Key take aways: assuming the 1:1 gridshell structure with filling developable plates the structural performance is satisfactory Next steps: calculation of the material thickness for 1:5 stiffness scaled model -> testing the kinetic joints with tolerances - > preparation of the fabrication files 06 - Stiffness-scaled models Calculating the thickness of plywood for stiffness-scaled model 1:5.

Key take aways: considering stiffness-scaling, already for 1:5 scale, I need a very thin plywood of 0.8mm-1mm, therefore the 1:5 scale was considered as suitable for prototype Defining structurally sound shell thickness The shell structural analysis was conducted with Karamba3d. assuming the subsurface is a shell of constant thickness, uniformly supported at all edges (Fig.2), made with birch plywood with the following properties: Elasticity Modulus (E) = 8750MPa, Bending Strength, Density (\ud835\udee0) = 450kg/m3, Compressive Strength (fco) = 38MPa.

OPTISHELL-GOLDFISH optimizer Within the OPTIshell project a multi-objective version of the recent Constraint Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization without Velocity (CMPSOWV) is developed. With the focus on wider adoption of optimization aimed at solving multi-objective constrained engineering design problems in practice, the proposed method is implemented in the popular Grasshopper framework as a new optimization plug-in \u201cGoldfish\u201d. As CMPSOWV, the MOCMPSOWV algorithm is supposed to obtain highly diversified optimization results thanks to incorporating the multi-swarm approach and the enlarged search scope for the best solution in the multiple locations of the hyperspace. The introduced MOCMPSOWV algorithm in the Goldfish framework has proven its superiority over algorithms such as: MOPSO, NSGA-II, SPEA, SPEA2, MOGA, MOEA/D in the quality of solution criteria and computing time in the engineering design problems such as: Welded beam case, Pressure Vessel case and multi-objective test functions.

The script accounts for the laser beam size (kerf), material thickness, width of the material and tolerances. The joint connection shape can be rectangular or defined by custom draw curve. Key take aways: the material thickness was around 0.88mm, and the slot had 1mm width, not taking into account kerf, allowing on the rotation around 75deg -> this caused difficulty to assemble it in the flat state, but also triggered the self-assembly effect larger tolerances on joints cause that elements that has few connections required fastening to not fall off from the flat model state Next steps: accounting for kerf, and the mobility of 60 deg will help in the flat assembly, but decrease the self assembly \"willingness\" self-interlocking joint would allow to keep the larger tolerances and prevent from falling of elements in the flat state","title":"Design &amp; Fabrication"},{"location":"nav/science/optishell/#03-structural-analysis-single-vs-double-layer","text":"Design Workflow Realizing the complexity of the asymptotic gridshell design enabling erection from a flat grid. source: Schling, E., & Schikore, J.

However, as the structural analysis shows above, the structure is too weak with the single layer plywood laths 6.5mm thick. Increasing thickness is not possible due to the bending (thicker material cannot bend that easily and can easily break- causing structural failure). The project assumption is to use kinetic movement for assembly (and maybe disassembly), preferably only once in the Life Cycle of the structure - to assemble it on the site. The assembly device should work as assembler of the structure and not as a kinetic actuator for the kinetic sculpture. Therefore to keep the single layer of the asymptotic grid (which can be easily assembled from flat), I added a developable plates, which will be mounted between laths after assembly to check the structural performance.

One of the nominated by me projects S\u2019lowtecture: housing structure by Tomasz Broma won in the completion and was presented at 15th International Architecture Exhibition\u2013 La Biennale di Venezia.","title":"Supervising and mentoring"},{"location":"portfolio/001/","text":"2023 Living Knitwork Pavilion - Burning Man 2023 Honoraria One of the highlighted projects merging technology with the beauty and craftsmanship of fine arts, the Living Knitwork Pavilion recently received the Black Rock City Honoraria Grant from the Burning Man Organization. The project was designed and built by Irmandy Wicaksono and interdisicplinary collective of MIT PhD students, staff members and alumni I designed the central asymptotic tower structure. www.media.mit.edu https://www.livingknit.work/ archdaily.com archinect.com 2022-2024 OPTIshell - Asymptotic Gridshell Fab Academy - Judy Curie - Final Project project website OPTIshell timber gridshell deliver the best structural-energy performance at a minimal cost while providing outstanding aesthetics. OPTIshell is an asymptotic gridshell based on a minimal surface. The structure is fabricated with planar straight strips of material with no waste and assembled from a flat bi-directional grid. 2020 - Polish Pavilion for EXPO2020 - pv instllation more about the project Perovskite PV installation on the Polish Pavilion for EXPO 2020. Project prepared and realized with Saule Technologies. 2019 INFRAME - Geodesic Gridshell project website MIT Digital Structures Group The INFRAME pavilion is a temporary timber elastic gridshell structure built on the MIT campus in September 2019 as part of Judyta Cichocka's CEE MEng thesis. The structure transforms the function of the public staircase between buildings E15 and E25 on the MIT campus into a performance area. A single layer gridshell becomes a real temporary outdoor stage for electronic music performances, a canvas for a video-mapping show, and has multiple imaginary roles invented by potential next owners. The ultimate goal of the project was to design an elastic timber gridshell, which can be constructed in real-life scenario, providing a functional space for experimental artistic performances and which endeavors to embody the principles of structural art: economy, efficiency and elegance. The challenge lied in development of the design strategy, which allows rapid construction by a small group of inexperienced builders at minimum cost while complying to the building code in Massachusetts (which was required by MIT). 2016 Hiriwa Pavilion - Metal Shell Pavilion A winning visit for international design student Hiriwa pavilion is an experimental structure which endeavors to reinterpret the function of steel, and uses steel as textile or fabric. The perforated steel plates form a lattice membrane for a small outdoor pavilion. 2015 Katipo - Multimaterial 3D-printed eyewear project website HONORABLE MENTION, RESHAPE15 | WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION. Honorable mention for the design of eyeglass frames using evolutionary structural optimization techniques, project presented at four international exhibitions in Barcelona and Rome, Awarding institution: NOUMENA, IN (3D) INDUSTRY More projects coming soon","title":"001"},{"location":"portfolio/001/#2023-living-knitwork-pavilion-burning-man-2023-honoraria","text":"One of the highlighted projects merging technology with the beauty and craftsmanship of fine arts, the Living Knitwork Pavilion recently received the Black Rock City Honoraria Grant from the Burning Man Organization.
