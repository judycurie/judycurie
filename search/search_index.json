Project prepared and realized with Saule Technologies. 2019 INFRAME - Geodesic Gridshell project website MIT Digital Structures Group The INFRAME pavilion is a temporary timber elastic gridshell structure built on the MIT campus in September 2019 as part of Judyta Cichocka's CEE MEng thesis. The structure transforms the function of the public staircase between buildings E15 and E25 on the MIT campus into a performance area. A single layer gridshell becomes a real temporary outdoor stage for electronic music performances, a canvas for a video-mapping show, and has multiple imaginary roles invented by potential next owners. The ultimate goal of the project was to design an elastic timber gridshell, which can be constructed in real-life scenario, providing a functional space for experimental artistic performances and which endeavors to embody the principles of structural art: economy, efficiency and elegance. The challenge lied in development of the design strategy, which allows rapid construction by a small group of inexperienced builders at minimum cost while complying to the building code in Massachusetts (which was required by MIT). 2016 Hiriwa Pavilion - Metal Shell Pavilion A winning visit for international design student Hiriwa pavilion is an experimental structure which endeavors to reinterpret the function of steel, and uses steel as textile or fabric.

Organizers: LabDigiFab (Marta Pakowska, Joanna Symonowicz, Judyta Cichocka, Maciej Nisztuk, Jakub \u0141awicki, Konrad Kulwicki, Magdalena Grzegorzewska, Agnieszka Wolska). Participation in industrial innovation My research has been always application-oriented, therefore during my carrier I collaborated with industry (AJ System, Perfopol, 3YOURMIND). I also set-up my own innovation-based company Parametric Support UG. In 2016, I received a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Energy (BMWi) to create an application for multi-criteria optimization of architectural design. The optimizer co-created by me was awarded in the preset competition \"MACHINE LEARNING ACROSS DISCIPLINES\" organized by MIT in 2019. The application was used in the optimization of several projects in Mexico and Germany in cooperation with such offices as: Fernando Romero Enterprise, Tatiana Bilbao or GVA Architectos. My company Parametric Support UG was providing consulting services in the field of Architectural Design Optimization (ADO), and in 2017 was selected to TOP30 of European companies working to improve the climate of CLIMATE-KIC.
