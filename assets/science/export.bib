   abstract = {Engineers and architects are now turning to use computational aids in order to analyze and solve complex design problems. Most of these problems can be handled by techniques that exploit Evolutionary Computation (EC). However existing EC techniques are slow [8] and hard to understand, thus disengaging the user. Swarm Intelligence (SI) relies on social interaction, of which humans have a natural understanding, as opposed to the more abstract concept of evolutionary change. The main aim of this research is to introduce a new solver Silvereye, which implements Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the Grasshopper framework, as the algorithm is hypothesized to be fast and intuitive. The second objective is to test if SI is able to solve complex design problems faster than EC-based solvers. Experimental results on a complex, single-objective high-dimensional benchmark problem of roof geometry optimization provide statistically significant evidence of computational inexpensiveness of the introduced tool.},

   abstract = {For several years great effort has been devoted to the study of Architectural Design Optimization (ADO). However, although in the recent years ADO has attracted much attention from academia, optimization methods and tools have had a limited influence on the architectural profession. The aim of the study is to reveal users' expectations from the optimization tools and define limitations preventing widespread adaptation of the optimization solvers in the architectural practice. The paper presents the results of the survey "Optimization in the architectural practice" conducted between December 2015 and February 2016 on 165 architectural trainees and practising architects from 34 countries. The results show that there is a need for an interactive multi-objective optimization tool, as 78% respondents declared that a multi-objective optimization is more necessary in their practice than a single objective one and 91% of them acknowledged the need for choice of promising solutions during optimization process. Finally, it has been found that daylight , structure and geometry are three top factors which architects are interested in optimizing.},

@article{Wortmann2022,
   abstract = {Although there is a substantial body of academic literature on Architectural Design Optimization (ADO), not much is known about actual ADO practices and user experiences. This paper presents results from an international user study of ADO with 186 respondents from various disciplines in architecture and building engineering. Compared to earlier user surveys from the literature, this survey employed a significantly larger sample size with active users of optimization in both industry and academia. The survey provides a comprehensive perspective on optimization in practice and highlights its utility for building design. Results can inform future developments of optimization tools to better suit needs and preferences of users, highlight a need to introduce optimization into architectural curricula, and ultimately contribute to the design of a more resource- and energy-efficient built environment. Most importantly, our survey suggests a non-ideal usage of optimization in design and research practice leading to, in the worst case, wrong conclusions drawn from optimization results. One prominent example in our survey is the potential over-reliance of (canonic) Genetic Algorithms for simulation-based problems: In the presence of low evaluation budgets, such algorithms will not converge, and modern model-based solvers would be more suitable. This demonstrates an urgent need to inform practitioners on more efficient tools suitable to the optimization task by, e.g., fostering the easy accessibility of such tools.},
